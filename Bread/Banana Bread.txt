Banana Bread

Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (I typically add a heaping 1tsp since I love cinnamon!)
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
3/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
2 large eggs at room temperature
1/3 cup plain yogurt or sour cream (I use plain Greek yogurt)
1 tsp of vanilla extract
3-4 large ripe bananas, mashed
optional: 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and/or chocolate chips

1. preheat oven to 350. spray a loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray or grease with butter and set aside 
*I use spray coconut oil instead of butter, and I use a Bundt pan instead of loaf pan*
2. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl
3. Using a mixer (or by hand!), beat the butter and brown sugar together until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
4. Beat in yogurt, mashed bananas, vanilla until combined
5. Slowly add dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over mix
6. Fold in nuts and/or chocolate (optional)
7. Sprinkle granulated sugar on top (it  makes a great crust!)
8. Put batter in loaf pan and bake for 60-65 minutes. Remove bread and allow to cool.

This bread keeps for 2 days on the counter or 1 week in the fridge.
