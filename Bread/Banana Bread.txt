Banana Bread
*I had to bake this a lot longer than the time says to, not sure if I didn't mix it properly or what*

Ingredients:
1 stick of butter (8 tbsp)
3 large ripe bananas
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon (I would probably add more like 1 tsp!)

1. preheat oven to 350. spray a loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray or grease with butter and set aside (I use spray coconut oil)
2. add the stick of butter to a large bowl and microwave for 1 minute, or until melted
3. add the bananas to the same bowl and mash with a fork
4. add the vanilla extract and egg to the bowl, use the same fork to mash and stir until there are no yellow streaks of egg remaining (I scrambled the eggs first with the vanilla)
5. in a second large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon
6. add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix together with a spatula until combined
7. pour the batter into the loap pan, bake for 45-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean
