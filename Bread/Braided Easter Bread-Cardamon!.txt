Braided Easter Bread (i.e. cardamon bread!)

Ingredients:
6 to 6.5 cups of all purpose flour 
1/2 cup sugar
2 packages of active dry yeast
1 to 2 tsp ground cardamom
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups milk
6 tbsp butter, cubbed
4 eggs
3 hard boiled eggs (colored!)
vegetable oil
2 tbsp cold water

1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, cardamom, and salt. 
2. In a saucepan, heat milk and butter to 120-130 degrees. Add to dry ingredients, beaten until moistened
3. Add 3 eggs, beat until smooth
4. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough
5. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes
6. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough into thirds and braid, bringing ends together to form a ring and pinch ends to seal. Separate out braids and place 3 hard boiled (colored) eggs. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 20 minutes
7. Beat water and remaining egg (1). Gently brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees for 28 to 32 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
