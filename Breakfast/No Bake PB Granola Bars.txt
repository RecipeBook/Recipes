5 Minute No Bake Peanut Butter Granola Bars

(makes about 12 bars)

Ingredients:

Dry (use scant measurements):

1 & 3/4 C rolled oats
1 C crisp puffed brown rice cereal
1/4 C pumpkin seeds
1/4 C sunflower seeds
1/4 C chia seeds OR 1/8 C finely ground flaxseed (both optional)
1/4 C unsweetened coconut (optional)
Wet (use generous measurements):

1/2 C brown rice syrup
1/3 C creamy peanut butter
1 tsp. vanilla extract (optional)
Instructions:

1) Add all the dry ingredients to a large bowl. Mix them together.

2) In a separate (microwave safe) bowl, mix together the wet ingredients, then microwave them for about 20 to 30 seconds. This will make it easier to mix and add to the dry ingredients since it’s really sticky!

3) Pour wet ingredients into dry and mix! Keep mixing until the wet binding ingredients are as well distributed as possible. Put some muscle into it! ;)

4) Put the mixture into a shallow pan and flatten it down. Place pan in fridge to let the bars chill/set. 

5) After about 30 minutes in the fridge (or you can wait until the next day – whatever works), cut them into bars, then wrap them up in foil and store back in the fridge (or in the freezer!) for easy grabbing and go-ing! These bars make great gifts, too. :)
