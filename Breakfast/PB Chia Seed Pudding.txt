INSTRUCTIONS
Add oats, chia seeds, cinnamon and sea salt to a mason jar and mix well. Add in almond milk, water, vanilla and mashed banana. Stir until combined.
In a small bowl, mix PB powder with water, until creamy. You can double the ingredients for extra peanut butter-y flavor! Stir "peanut butter" mixture into mason jar. You can add toppings now or in the morning!
Refrigerate overnight or at least 4 hours. Dig in with a spoon and enjoy!
