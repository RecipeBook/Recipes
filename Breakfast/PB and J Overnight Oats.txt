INGREDIENTS
1 cup old fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups almond milk
2 Tablespoons peanut butter (or 4 Tablespoons peanut flour)
1 scoop vanilla protein powder
dash of cinnamon
1 batch of berry chia jam (I used Trader's Joe's Very Cherry Berry Blend instead of frozen strawberries for this batch)

INSTRUCTIONS
Make a batch of berry chia jam following the recipe for my strawberry chia seed jam.
In the meantime, put oats, almond milk, peanut butter, protein powder and cinnamon in a bowl and gently stir them together until the protein powder has dissolved. It's okay if the peanut butter is a little clumpy. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for 1-2 hours, or overnight.
Once the overnight oats have set up (and absorbed most of the almond milk) you’re ready to serve them!
You can simply separate the overnight oats into two containers and use the berry chia jam as a topping. Carefully add it to the top in the shape of a heart if you want to have the heart on top.
Or you can create a layered version. To make the layered version simply place ¼ of the overnight oats in a container, place ¼ of the berry chia jam on top, cover with another ¼ of the overnight oats and top with more berry chia jam (shaped in a heart, if desired). Use remaining oats and chia jam to make a second bowl of layered overnight oats and serve.
