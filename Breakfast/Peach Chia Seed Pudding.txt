Ingredients:
¼ cup rolled oats (not instant), gluten-free if preferred
½ cup Chobani 0% Peach Yogurt
6 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk or dairy-free milk of choice
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1 small peach, pitted and diced
cinnamon

Directions:
Combine oats, yogurt, almond milk and Mila in a small bowl. Stir well. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

Stir in an additional splash of milk if the mixture is very thick (it will become thicker the longer it is left to stand.) Layer in a clear glass with diced peaches and cinnamon.
