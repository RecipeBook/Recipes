INGREDIENTS
½  cup flour for dredging
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
4  skinless boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each
2  tablespoons olive oil
4  sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
2  tablespoons finely chopped shallots
2  teaspoons finely chopped garlic
2  teaspoons grated lemon zest
3  tablespoons lemon juice
½  cup chicken broth, fresh or canned
2  tablespoons butter

1: Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over. Remove the excess flour.

2: Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

3: Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked through. Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken. Discard the oil.

4: Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do not burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the broth.

5: Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom. Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
