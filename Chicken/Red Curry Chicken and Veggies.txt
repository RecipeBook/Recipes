INGREDIENTS
1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
1 red bell pepper cut into match sticks
1 small japanese eggplant peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons red curry paste
1 small zucchini squash chopped
1 small yellow squash chopped
.5 to .75 pound boneless skinless chicken breast (1 breast), sliced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes optional
1/4 teaspoon sea salt to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
Heat ¼ cup of the canned coconut milk over medium-high heat in a large skillet or wok.

Add the bell pepper and eggplant. Cover and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the remaining coconut milk and red curry paste and bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the yellow squash, zucchini, sliced chicken, red pepper flakes, and sea salt. Cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and vegetables have reached desired doneness.
