2 Tbsp cumin
1 Tbsp paprika
2 tsp salt, or to taste
3/4 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1-3 tsp cayenne pepper (this is where the real spicy kick comes in, so use less for mild. If using Kalinda's pepper, add at the end after serving! super spicy!)
1 cup heavy cream (or 7/8 cream, 1/8 butter)
1/2 tbsp cornstarch

Prepared Long Grain White Rice or Basmati Rice
Chopped cilantro, for serving
