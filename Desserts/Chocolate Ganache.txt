Chocolate Ganache

Ingredients:
8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tsp instant coffee granules

Cook the chocolate chips, heavy cream, and instant coffee in the top of the double boiler over a simmering water until smooth and warm, stirring occasionally. If you don't have a double boiler, you can put in a pot on low heat and melt.
