Flourless Chocolate Torte

Ingredients:
1 1/2 sticks (12 tbsp) unsalted butter or margarine, cut into small pieces plus more for the pan (or use Pam)
12 ounces bittersweet chocolate (can chop if you want)
6 large eggs
1/2 cup sugar
Pinch of kosher salt
Unsweetened cocoa powder or powdered sugar for topping

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease pan with butter or Pam. 
2. Combine the chocolate and 1 1/2 sticks butter in a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl oveer a saucepan of simmering water and stir until melted and combined (i.e. double boiler). Remove the bowl from the saucepan and cool slightly. 
3. Combine the eggs, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and thick (about 5-8 minutes)
4. Gently fold half of the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until just combined, then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 35-45 minutes or until the top is no longer shiny, barely jiggles, and toothpick from corners comes out clean. 
5. Transfer to rack and let cool. Top with cocoa powder, powdered sugar, or ganache
