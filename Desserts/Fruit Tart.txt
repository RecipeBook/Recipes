1 premade graham cracker crust (can make own crust. i would make them into minis for easier eating and put them in cupcake cups)
1 package of vanilla or lemon pudding
1 whole orange; zested
assortment of fruit (I use blueberries, raspberries/blackberries, and strawberries)


1) go buy the stuff. have fun choosing the fruit!
2) make pudding. follow the instructions on package and let sit for 5 minutes until firm
3) mix pudding with orange zest. add to crust.
4) top with fruit in a pattern, trying to cover as much area as possible. maybe put blueberries in pudding, to give it more texture?
5) eat! store in fridge, covered
