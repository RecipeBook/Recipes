Vanilla Pastry Cream
from Chef Gail Sokol
makes 2 1/2 cups

1 cup whole milk removing 2 tbsp and set aside
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 large egg yolks
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp vanilla extract

1) in a heavy, medium non-aluminum saucepan bring the milk (minus 2 tbsp) and cream to the boil
2 in a heatproff stainless steel or tempered glass mixing bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and 2 tbsp of reserved milk until there are no lumps
3) slowly drizzle the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until all the milk has been added. pour the mixture back into the saucepan and place it over medium high heat. bring to ta boil, whisking all the time. the mixture will become thick. boil and whisk for 1 minute. do not allow it to burn!
4) remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. pour the custard into a bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the custard to prevent a skin from forming. place it in the fridge until cold, about 3 to 4 hours. the custard filling can be made 1 day in advance and should be kept chilled in the fridge
