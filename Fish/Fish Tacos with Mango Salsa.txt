¼ teaspoon ancho chili powder
½ teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon lime zest
2 tablespoons of olive oil

Mango Salsa:
1 large mango, diced
2 tablespoons diced red onion
2 tablespoons diced fresh cilantro

Instructions
Heat grill to medium high heat (about 375-400 degrees).
In a small bowl, add cumin, smoked paprika, ancho chili powder, ½ teaspoon salt, and lime zest. Gently mix with a spoon.
Pat the cod dry, rub spice blend into the fish.
Drizzle olive oil over both sides of the fish.
Place fish on the grill and grill for 3-5 minutes per side. (DO NOT TOUCH WHILE IT'S GRILLING OR YOU'LL HAVE A MESS)
Once fish is done, remove from the grill and let rest.
In the meantime, to a small bowl add mangos, red onion, fresh cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt to taste. Gently toss to mix all the ingredients. Set aside.
Make the chimichurri: to a small food processor add ¾ cup fresh cilantro, fresh oregano, garlic clove, red pepper flakes, ¼ teaspoon cumin, red wine vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of lime juice. Blend until the herbs are finely chopped. Add in the 3 tablespoons of olive oil, pulse until everything is combined.
Assemble your tacos: add one corn tortilla, 1-2 oz. of cod, top with mango salsa, purple cabbage, 2 slices of avocado, and chimichurri sauce.
