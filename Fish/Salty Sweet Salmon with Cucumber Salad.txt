FOR THE PRESERVED GINGER:
¼  cup fish sauce
1 ½  teaspoons rice-wine vinegar
¾  teaspoon sugar, or to taste
¼  cup peeled and finely grated (or minced) ginger
FOR THE SALMON:
¼  cup honey
¼  cup soy sauce
1  clove garlic, crushed
1 ½  tablespoons ketchup
4  6-ounce pieces salmon fillet
FOR THE CUCUMBERS:
1  cup rice-wine vinegar
¼  cup sugar
1  tablespoon kosher salt
½  teaspoon togarashi (or ground red pepper flakes)
1 ½  teaspoons grated ginger
1  English cucumber, seeded and sliced 1/8,-inch thick

1: Make the preserved ginger: The day before, whisk together the fish sauce, rice-wine vinegar and sugar, then add the ginger. Make sure it is covered by the liquid.
Combine the honey, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup and 1/4 cup water. Marinate the salmon in this for 2 hours, turning after 1 hour.

2: Meanwhile, prepare the cucumber salad: Bring the vinegar to a boil. Add the sugar, salt, togarashi and ginger. Return to a boil, then let cool to room temperature. Put the cucumbers in a nonreactive container and cover with the vinegar mixture. Let sit at least one hour before serving.

3: Preheat grill to low. Arrange salmon on a hinged grill basket, then cook, basting occasionally with the marinade, over a low flame for 5 minutes per side, or until just flaky. (Or broil, skin side down, 6 inches from the flame for 4 minutes, baste, then turn and broil for 2 minutes.) To serve, use a slotted spoon to place the cucumber salad on each of 4 plates. Lay the salmon next to the salad and serve topped with preserved ginger.
