1/2 stick of butter
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup flour
2 cups milk
8-16oz cheese (I like cheddar, but feel free to add whatever you have on hand! Recently I've made it with parmesan and asiago, as well as provolone and swiss!)
pasta (elbow works the best)

melt the half stick of butter in a pan. add salt and pepper
add 1/4 cup of flour and mix until combined and thick
add the 2 cups of milk and bring to a boil
add the cheese and combine until all is melted
combine with pasta and put in a baking pan. bake at 350F for 15-20 minutes or until golden and crunchy on top
