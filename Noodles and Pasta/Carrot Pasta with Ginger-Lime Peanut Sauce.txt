Ingredients
For the Carrot Pasta:
5 large carrots peeled and spiraled into noodles
1/3 cup roasted cashews
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro finely chopped

For the Ginger-Lime Peanut Sauce:
2 tablespoons unsalted unsweetened creamy peanut butter
4 tablespoons coconut milk
2 tablespoons liquid aminos
Pinch cayenne pepper
2 cloves large garlic finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh ginger peeled and grated
1 tablespoon lime juice
Kosher salt to taste

Instructions
To Prepare the Ginger-Lime Peanut Sauce:
1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix together until smooth and creamy.
To Prepare the Carrot Pasta:
1. Wash carrots well, peel them, and pat them dry.
2. Using your spiral slicer, make noodles out of all of the carrots. It will be more difficult to make the noodles
once there is only a few inches of carrot left, so you can grate what’s left of the carrot.
3. Place all carrot noodles into a large serving bowl. Pour the Ginger-Lime Peanut Sauce over the noodles and
gently toss together (I use my hands for this part).
4. Serve with roasted cashews (or peanuts) and freshly chopped cilantro.

Recipe Notes
If you don't have a spiral slicer, you can simply grate the carrots with a box grater to make this recipe.
