CREAMY ROASTED RED PEPPER SAUCE:
3 red bell peppers
1 cup almond milk (I prefer Almond Breeze Almondmilk Cashewmilk blend because it’s a little creamier than most)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup tahini or almond butter for thickening

FOR THE ZUCCHINI NOODLE (or just use normal pasta)
1 tablespoon olive oil
(a few thin slices of shallot or onion, if you want)
4 zucchini, ends cut off and spiralized or cut into ‘noodles’
salt to taste

INSTRUCTIONS

ROAST THE PEPPERS: Place the bell peppers on a foil lined baking sheet. Turn on the broiler and roast the peppers on the top level, close to the heating element. When black spots appear, turn the peppers and continue to roast until all sides have been blackened. Let cool and pull off blackened skins and remove ribs, seeds, and stem.

MAKE THE SAUCE: Add the 3 roasted bell peppers to a blender with the rest of the sauce ingredients and blend until smooth.

ZUCCHINI NOODLES: Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the olive oil and onion – sauté for a minute or two until the onion is softened but not browned. Add the zucchini noodles to the skillet. Sauté using a pair of non-stick tongs to toss the noodles. Just as the zucchini noodles begin to soften, but before they start shedding water, sprinkle with salt and add the sauce and cook just until the sauce is heated. When in doubt, my leaning is to undercook these!

SERVE: Adjust the salt to your taste, and serve immediately with any toppings you might like, such as: parsley, Parmesan, goat cheese, truffle oil, that sort of thing.
