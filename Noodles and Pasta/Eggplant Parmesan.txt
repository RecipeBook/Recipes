Eggplant Parmesan

Ingredients:
Eggplant (1 large), cut into 1/4 inch rounds and skin removed
Eggs (depends on how much eggplant you have)
Milk
Bread crumbs
Mozarella cheese
Ricotta
Parmesan cheese


1. After cutting eggplant, lay on paper towels to dry, cover with paper towels
2. Leave on paper towels for a few hours (probably about 4 hours or more)
3. Heat oil in large skillet (enough for the eggplant to float on the oil and not touch the bottom)
4. Mix eggs and small amount of milk in bowl (you will probably need to do this more than once depending on how much eggplant you have). Fill another bowl of bread crumbs
5. Egg and bread the eggplant pieces
6. Fry in hot oil until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towel lined dish 
7. In a large baking pan, put a thin layer of sauce on bottom.
Make a layer of eggplant, top with ricotta cheese on each eggplant piece (I squish the ricotta to cover the entire piece of eggplant), a little bit of shredded mozzarella, sauce, and then top with another eggplant piece.  Make little stacks this way until you run out of eggplant or sauce, whichever comes first.
8. For the final layer (donâ€™t let the layers go above the sides of the baking dish), just put sauce on top of eggplant stack and shredded mozzarella, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
9. Bake at 350 degree oven until the sauce is bubbling and hot
10. You can just lift a stack of eggplant parm from the baking dish and eat! No cutting needed.


If you want to freeze the eggplant parm, cover with a layer of wax paper or parchment paper, then foil and freeze (the wax paper prevents the foil from sticking to the cheese).  When you want to bake the frozen eggplant parm, remove the parchment paper and foil and follow next step. Or you can bake the eggplant parm (next step) and then freeze, then microwave to thaw and eat.


Enjoy!!
