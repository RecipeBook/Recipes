 Salt (optional)
3  ounces lime juice (from about 3 limes)
3  tablespoons fish sauce
1.5  tablespoons sugar
2  tablespoons nam prik pao (Thai chile paste in oil)
2  finely chopped Thai bird chiles, or to taste
1  pound large shrimp (1 1/2 pounds if heads-on)
2/3  cup very thinly sliced lemongrass (see note)
1  large shallot, thinly sliced
1/2  cup roughly chopped cilantro
1/2  cup whole mint leaves
6  kaffir lime leaves, finely shredded
 Jasmine rice, for serving

Bring a pot of 3 quarts of water to a boil. (I like to salt the water like pasta water; Kanittanon does not add salt.)

In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, nam prik pao and chopped chiles. Taste, and adjust with any of the ingredients, including salt. The sauce’s flavor should be led by sourness and savoriness, but with a good balance of sweetness and heat.

Cook the shrimp in the water until it just turns opaque, medium or medium-rare, about 1 minute. For better flavor, cook the shrimp with heads or shells on; peel when just cooled enough to handle.

Add the shrimp to the sauce while still warm and toss; the lime will continue to “cook” the shrimp like a ceviche. Add the lemongrass, shallot, cilantro, mint leaves and kaffir lime leaves, reserving a little of each herb for garnish. Toss, and place on a dish; scatter the reserved herbs on top. Serve immediately with hot rice.
