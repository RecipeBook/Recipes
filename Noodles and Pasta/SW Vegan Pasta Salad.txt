Ingredients
8 ounces Fusilli pasta (I use lentil pasta for extra protein)
1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and thoroughly rinsed
1 cup frozen fire-roasted corn, thawed
1/4 cup sliced black olives (optional)
1 bunch (6–8) scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
Large handful cilantro leaves, finely chopped


Instructions
Bring a pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil. (As they say, your pasta water should be as salted as the sea.)
Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to package instructions. Strain.
Meanwhile, prepare all remaining salad ingredients and set aside.
Prepare the dressing (see recipe below).
Add the pasta and all remaining ingredients to a large serving bowl. Drizzle with the dressing, to taste, and toss to coat.
Taste and season with sea salt and black pepper, if desired.
Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Serve chilled.

Chipotle Dressing
Ingredients
1/2 cup raw cashews or shelled hemp seeds
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons filtered water
1 to 2 tablespoons finely diced chipotle pepper in adobo sauce or more, to taste (I recommend 2 tbsp)
1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled
1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
3/4 teaspoon sea salt or to taste

Instructions
Add all ingredients to a high-speed blender, and blend on high until emulsified. Alternatively, combine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and whisk vigorously until emulsified.
