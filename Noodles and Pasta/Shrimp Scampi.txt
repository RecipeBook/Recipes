2  tablespoons butter
2  tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4  garlic cloves, minced
1/2  cup dry white wine or broth
3/4  teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/8  teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
 Freshly ground black pepper
1.75  pounds large or extra-large shrimp, shelled
1/3  cup chopped parsley
 Freshly squeezed juice of half a lemon
 Cooked pasta or crusty bread

In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine or broth, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Let wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.
Add shrimp and sauté until they just turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes depending upon their size. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice and serve over pasta or accompanied by crusty bread.
