12  ounces baby bok choy (3 or 4 small heads)
1  ounce ginger root (1 fat 2-inch-thick knob)
 Kosher salt
8  ounces rice noodles, not too thin
2  tablespoons peanut or safflower oil
1  pound lean ground pork
¼  cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
2  tablespoons rice wine vinegar
½  cup thinly sliced scallions
3  garlic cloves, finely chopped
1  fresh Thai or habanero chile, seeded if desired, thinly sliced
2  tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 ½  teaspoons sesame oil, more for drizzling
 Cilantro or torn basil, for serving
 Black vinegar, for serving

Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, breaking up with a fork, until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1/2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a bowl.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Stir in half the scallions, the finely chopped ginger, the garlic and the chile. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add bok choy stems and a pinch of salt. Cook until bok choy is almost tender, about 2 minutes. Toss in leaves and return pork to skillet.

Toss noodles, remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar into the pan. Cook until just warmed through.

Transfer to a large bowl and toss with remaining scallions, sesame seeds, sesame oil and herbs. In a small bowl, combine ginger matchsticks with just enough black vinegar to cover. Serve ginger mixture alongside noodles as a garnish.
