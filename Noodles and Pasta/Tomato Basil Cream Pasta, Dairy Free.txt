Ingredients
2–3 large, ripe tomatoes
1 cup raw cashews
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced, optional
1 pound whole wheat spaghetti
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1–2 teaspoons freshly cracked, coarse black pepper
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped

Instructions
Put a large pot of salted water on to boil. Core the tomatoes and roughly chop. Add it to your blender or food processor — seeds, skin and all. Add cashews, tomato paste, and water. Blend until very smooth. Add olive oil to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden, being careful not to burn. Once water is boiling, add pasta. Pour sauce from the blender into the saute pan and bring to a simmer. Add salt and let cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let simmer until pasta is finished cooking. Once pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain. Add pasta to the saute pan with black pepper and freshly chopped basil leaves. Toss to coat and use reserved pasta water to thin sauce to desired consistency. Serve immediately, garnishing with more pepper and basil.
