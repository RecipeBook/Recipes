Salt
2 Tbsp oil
8 ounces ground pork or thinly sliced pork shoulder
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1 Tbsp minced ginger
1 head Napa Cabbage (1 1/2 to 2 pounds), chopped
8 ounces rice, buckwheat (sobs), or wheat noodles, preferably whole grain
3 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp sesame oil
2 tsp chile oil, or to taste (chili paste, flakes, whole dried, minced fresh, etc)
black pepper
lime wedges



1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Put the oil in a large, deep skillet 
over medium-high heat and, a minute later, add the pork, sprinkle with salt, and 
cook, stirring occasionally (and if you’re using ground pork, breaking up the meat as 
you cook), until the pork browns and is no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted 
spoon to remove the pork and lower the heat to medium-low.

2. Add the garlic and ginger to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the 
garlic softens, just 1 minute. Add the cabbage along with 1/2 Cup water and cook, 
stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is softened and the water evaporates, about 
15 minutes. Lower the heat and continue to cook, stirring once in a while, until the 
cabbage begins to brown, about 5 minutes more.

3. When the cabbage is almost ready, cook the noodles in the boiling water until 
tender but not mushy. Check them frequently: the time will vary from a minute or 2 
for thin rice noodles to 5 minutes for soba, or up to 12 minutes for wide brown rice 
noodles. When the noodles are done in the skillet along with the pork, soy sauce, 
sesame oil, chili oil and some black pepper; add some of the cooking water if the 
mixture seems dry. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve 
with lime wedges.
