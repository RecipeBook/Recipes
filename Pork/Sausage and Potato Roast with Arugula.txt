1 3/4 pounds mixed unpeeled potatoes (red, yukon gold, fingerlings or russet), if small/baby, cut in half, if larger, in 1-inch thick wedges
10 medium (about 1/2 pound) unpeeled shallots, halved
Olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes
1 1/2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, cut into 3-inch lengths
One 5-ounce package of baby arugula or one 8-ounce bundle, stemmed and chopped
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar


Heat oven to 425°. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss all of the potatoes and shallots with 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt (I use 1 teaspoon kosher), and a lot freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste. Roast for 15 minutes, at which they’ll be barely beginning to color. Give them a toss and add sausages. Brush the tops with a little olive oil and return the tray to the oven for another 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the sausage is cooked through.
To finish: Transfer everything on the tray to a big bowl and add arugula, lemon juice, and more salt and pepper to taste. Serve right away.
