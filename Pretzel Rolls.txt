Dough
1 1/3 cups warm water
2 tbsp warm milk
2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
2 tbsp melted butter
4 cups all purpose flour
2 tbsp white sugar
Parboiling
2 quarts water (8 cups?)
1/2 cup baking soda
Topping
1 egg; scambled
1/4 cup kosher salt


1) In the bowl of a standing mixer, mix a ? cup of warm water with the yeast and let stand until foamy.

2) Add the remaining cup of warm water along with milk, sugar and melted butter and swirl to dissolve the sugar (I am assuming the brown sugar first)
3) Then add flour and other sugar

4) Mix on medium low with dough hook until dough forms a nice pliable dough ball. Add flour as needed

5) Knead for two minutes, then roll into a 2 foot long log and cut into 12 even pieces and form into rolls or any shape

6) Cover dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let pretzels rest for about 30-40 minutes.

7) Preheat oven to 425. Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray

8) In a large stockpot, bring the cold water to a boil, remove from heat, and add baking soda (not while on heat! will boil over). Then return to heat. Drop two rolls into the boiling water and boil for no more than 30 seconds, turning once. remove and let drain. Brush egg on top and add salt. Repeat.

9) Bake on the upper and middle racks of the oven for about 15-20 minutes or until browned all over. Be sure to switch pans during baking every 5 minutes for more even baking
