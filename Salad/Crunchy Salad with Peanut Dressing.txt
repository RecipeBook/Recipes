Dressing:
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, from one lime
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey
2-1/2 tablespoons sugar
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1-inch square piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves

Salad:
4 cups chopped Napa cabbage or shredded coleslaw mix (I like to toss in a little shredded red cabbage for color)
1 cup prepared shredded carrots
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced into bite-sized pieces
1 small English cucumber, halved lengthwise, seeded and thinly sliced
1 cup cooked and shelled edamame
2 medium scallions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh cilantro


For the dressing, combine all of the ingredients except for the cilantro in a blender and process until completely smooth.
Add the cilantro and blend for a few seconds until the cilantro is finely chopped. 
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
For the salad, combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl and toss to combine. 
If serving right away, drizzle the peanut dressing over top and toss; 
otherwise, serve the dressing on the side so the salad doesn't get soggy.
