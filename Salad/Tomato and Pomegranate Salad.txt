INGREDIENTS
2  pints mixed small or cherry tomatoes, of varying colors
2  teaspoons za’atar
3 1/2  tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 Seeds from 1 pomegranate
1/2  yellow bell pepper, seeds removed and very thinly sliced
1/2  small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
1/3  cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
1/3  cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, torn into pieces
1 1/2  teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
 Flaky sea salt
3 1/2  ounces manouri or feta cheese, broken into small chunks

Halve or quarter the tomatoes so that they are all roughly the same size, and place them in a large mixing bowl.

Mix the za’atar with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, and set aside.

To the bowl with tomatoes, add the pomegranate seeds, sliced pepper and onion, the herbs, lemon juice, the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. Gently mix the salad, then transfer it to a large shallow bowl or serving platter, and dot it with the cheese. Drizzle the za’atar mixture over the salad and serve.
