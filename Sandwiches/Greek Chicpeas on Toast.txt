INGREDIENTS
2 tbsp olive oil
3 small shallots, finely diced
2 large garlic cloves, finely diced
¼ tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp sweet paprika
½ tsp cinnamon (or cumin)
½ tsp salt
½-1 tsp sugar, to taste
black pepper, to taste
1 x 400 g tin of peeled plum tomatoes or 2 large tomatoes (skinned)
2 cups of cooked chickpeas
4-6 slices of crusty bread (gluten-free if required), toasted
fresh parsley and / or dill, to garnish (optional)
a few pitted Kalamata olives, to garnish (optional)

METHOD
Heat up olive oil on a medium pan.
Add shallots and fry gently, stirring frequently, until almost translucent. Add garlic and fry until shallots are completely translucent and garlic is softened.
Add all the spices to the pan. Mix them into the onion and garlic mixture and fry off gently for 1-2 minutes stirring the whole time.
Squash tinned tomatoes or chop them roughly before adding to the pan with a couple of tablespoons of water. Simmer on low-medium heat until the sauce has thickened.
Mix in cooked chickpeas and let them warm through in the sauce. Season with salt, sugar and black pepper.
Serve on toasted bread with a sprinkle of fresh herbs and a few black olives.
