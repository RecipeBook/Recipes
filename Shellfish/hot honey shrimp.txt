1  tablespoon honey
1/8  teaspoon cayenne
1/4  teaspoon grated lime zest
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1  garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or finely minced
1/4  teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1  pound cleaned extra-large shrimp, patted very dry with paper towels
1  tablespoon very cold butter, cubed
 Lime wedges, for serving
1  jalapeño, halved, seeded and very thinly sliced, for serving
1  tablespoon chives or scallion greens, finely chopped, for serving
 Mayonnaise, for serving (optional)

PREPARATION
Heat oven to 500 degrees. 

In a medium bowl, combine honey, cayenne, lime zest, ginger, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss in shrimp to coat.

Spread shrimp on a large rimmed baking sheet and dot with butter. Roast until shrimp is pink and opaque, but before the edges have started to curl, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle generously with fresh lime juice and toss with jalapeños and chives or scallions. Serve with mayonnaise if you like.
