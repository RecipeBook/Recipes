8 cups (2 L) water
½ bunch fresh parsley
¼ bunch fresh cilantro
¼ bunch fresh mint
5 cloves garlic, halved, divided
1 onion, roughly chopped
1 teaspoon paprika

1 cucumber, peeled
1 ¼ cups (305 g) greek yogurt
2 tablespoons fresh mint
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Preparation
Soak the chickpeas in the water for at least one night, ensuring that the chickpeas are fully submerged.
Drain the chickpeas in a colander. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and add the chickpeas. Cover with more paper towels and let dry for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350°F (180 °C).
Add the dried chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, coriander, mint, 5 cloves of garlic, onion, paprika, 2 teaspoons of cumin, ground coriander, baking soda, toasted sesame seeds, salt and pepper, in a blender and blend until smooth.
Use your hands to form falafel the size of a ping pong ball.
Place them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Brush the falafel with olive oil.
Bake for about 25-30 minutes.
To prepare the tzatziki, cut a cucumber in fourths and remove the seeds.
Use a box grater to grate the cucumber into a bowl.
Salt the grated cucumber and let sit for 5 minutes.
Place the salted cucumber into a sieve and press down with a spatula to remove excess liquid.
Mix the grated cucumber with Greek yogurt, 2 tablespoons of mint, the minced garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.
Serve the falafel with the tzatziki.
Enjoy!
