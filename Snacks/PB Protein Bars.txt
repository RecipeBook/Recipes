Ingredients
1 cup natural peanut butter
3/4 cup honey
1 1/2 cups quick oats (not instant)
1 cup vanilla protein powder

Instructions
Line a 9x9-inch or 7x11-in pan with parchment or wax paper.
In a medium microwave-safe bowl, heat the peanut butter and honey on high for 30 seconds. Stir. Place bowl back in the microwave and heat for another 30 seconds. Stir again. Mix in the oats and protein powder until combined. Immediately spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove from the fridge and cut into 12 bars. Cover and store on the counter at room temperature for up to 1 week. (I just store mine in the same pan with a lid.)
