2 large yellow onions, chopped
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 pkts of sugar/1 tbsp of sugar (sweet and low/real sugar is tied in my household. Will update after taste test)
2-32oz Nature's Promise Reduced Sodium beef broth
1/2 tsp dried thyme
2 tbs balsamic vinegar
salt and pepper
8 slices of swiss cheese (to taste)
thin baguette, cut into small slices

1) spray a large pan with nonstick cooking spray. add onions and 1 cup of beef broth and the garlic powder. sautee onions until broth is completely evaporated, and onions begin to caramelize.

2) add the rest of the ingredients (minus swiss) to the crockpot and add the onions when caramelized. turn the crockpot on high for 4 hours.

3) When ready to serve, put sliced bread into the bottom of the bowl, and ladle soup on top. place swiss cheese on top, one slice vertical and one horizontal (for full coverage). Broil in the oven on low for 2-3 minutes, or heat in the microwave to make the cheese goey. 

4) Eat!!
