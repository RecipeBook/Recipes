3  tablespoons olive oil, more for drizzling
1  large onion, chopped
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  tablespoon tomato paste
1  teaspoon ground cumin
¼  teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
¼  teaspoon ground black pepper
 Pinch of ground chile powder or cayenne, more to taste
1  quart chicken or vegetable broth
2  cups water
1  cup red lentils
1  large carrot, peeled and diced
 Juice of 1/2 lemon, more to taste
3  tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

1:In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high heat until hot and shimmering. Add onion and garlic, and sauté until golden, about 4 minutes.

2: Stir in tomato paste, cumin, salt, black pepper and chili powder or cayenne, and sauté for 2 minutes longer.
Add broth, 2 cups water, lentils and carrot. Bring to a simmer, then partially cover pot and turn heat to medium-low. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.

3: Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, purée half the soup then add it back to pot. Soup should be somewhat chunky.

4: Reheat soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro. Serve soup drizzled with good olive oil and dusted lightly with chili powder if desired.
