 I buy a rotisserie chicken and use the chicken meat from that to add to the soup. Its easier

In a pot add: 
2 tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic
1 cup diced onion
1/2 cup carrots
1/2 cup celery
Cook on medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring

Add:
32 oz chicken broth
2 cups fresh tortellini ( I buy Rana brand. Comes in a bag)
Cook on low heat 5-7 minutes, the tortellini should be floating (that means its done)

Add cooked chicken and 1/4 cup fresh parsley
Re-heat

Scoop soup into a bowl
Shave Parmesan cheese on top
Add salt and pepper to taste
