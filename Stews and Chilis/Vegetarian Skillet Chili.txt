Vegetarian Chili

For pickled onions:
1 lime
1 red onion or shallot, thinly sliced
Salt as needed
sugar as needed

Directions: squeeze the lime juice into a bowl and add everything. rest for 20 minutes (I personally put it in a mason jar over night so it gets really pickled)

Olive or grapeseed oil

Garlic cloves, minced
Chili powder
Dried oregano
2 (15oz) cans of beans, drained (I use kidney beans)
1 (15oz) can of diced tomatoes
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro, diced avocado, and sour cream for garnish

Directions:
1. heat a large skillet and add the oil. When hot, add the onions, saute until soft. 
2. add garlic, chile powde, and oregano and cook until fragrant. 
3. add beans and tomatoes and a few pinches of salt. Let simmer for 20 minutes or until the tomatoes break down
