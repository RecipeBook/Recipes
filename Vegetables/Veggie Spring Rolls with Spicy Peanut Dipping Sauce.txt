Ingredients:
20, 9 inch rice paper wrappers
8 ounces maifun or vermicelli rice noodles
2 heads romaine lettuce
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 hothouse cucumber, thinly sliced
2 heaping cups carrots, shredded
2 heaping cups purple cabbage, shredded
2 heaping cups mung bean sprouts

Spicy Peanut Dipping Sauce
1/2 cup natural peanut butter*
1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup coconut aminos (or soy sauce)
1/4 cup chili garlic sauce
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add rice noodles and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and rinse under cold water to stop cooking.
2. Trim romaine leaves to fit on the rice paper. Working with one rice paper at a time, submerge in a shallow bowl of water (a round cake pan works well) for 5 seconds. Remove rice paper from water and place on your work surface. Lay a romaine leaf on the paper, then layer on a small amount of rice noodles and each of the veggies.
3. Fold over one side of the rice paper then fold over top and bottom. Using a rolling motion, continue to seal rice paper on opposite side.
4. Store spring rolls in the fridge, uncut, for up to 5 days.

Spicy Peanut Dipping Sauce
1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Garnish with green onions.
2. Leftover sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to a week.

Notes
* I use salted peanut butter. If using unsalted peanut butter, add a pinch of sea salt to the dipping sauce.
